<H1>Themes</H1>
<P>Many users feel very strongly about how colors are used in
their software. To help accommodate this we provide a Theme mechanism
which allows the user to easily specify the default colors, fonts and
icons used by the program.</P>

<P>The theme mechanism is extensible - additional themes may be created.
For an example of this, see the themes
which are included with Metalworks. Note, like all of the L&F packages, 
the metal package is not yet frozen and the theme mechanism may change as 
we get developer feedback on how to improve it.</P>

<P>Note that if a UI such as Windows or Motif encounters a property such as
JSlider.fill which is does not understand that property will be ignored.&nbsp;
Thus you don't have to worry about problems which could arise if you switch
to a different L&F.</P>
